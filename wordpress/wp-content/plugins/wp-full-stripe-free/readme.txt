#####   Version 8.2.1 (2025-03-28)

- Fixes an issue with the settings page not opening if the user has migrated from a version older than 8.0




####   Version 8.2.0 (2025-03-17)

**New Features**  

- **Fee Recovery Support** – Added an option to **pass Stripe and plugin fees to customers**, either as an **optional or required checkbox**. This allows website owners to recover processing fees, ensuring they receive the full intended amount.  

- **Reporting Dashboard** – Introduced a **new reporting feature** with key insights into transactions and revenue. 

**Enhancements**  

- Added an **edit icon** to the form listing screen for easier and more intuitive editing.  
- Reverted the default form type from **external** to **inline** for better usability.  
- Improved the **admin status menu** to remain visible at all times, regardless of test or live mode. Added a **submenu** for quick access to Forms, Transactions, and Settings. Adjusted visual cues for test and live modes for better clarity.  
- **Revamped the Settings Page** for smoother navigation—introduced tabs and sub-tabs to make it easier to access different sections without returning to the main page.  
- **Streamlined Form Settings** by moving site-wide settings to a **global options** section, reducing clutter in individual form settings while still allowing granular control when needed.  
- **Automatic Stripe Product Creation** – Forms now automatically create a linked **Stripe product**, reducing setup steps for one-time and subscription payments.  

**Bug Fixes**  

- Fixed an issue where **form preview did not reflect changes immediately**. Users are now informed when a save is required before previewing, preventing confusion.  
- Fixed an issue where **save card forms did not work with external checkout**. Now, selecting a save card form automatically switches to **inline checkout** and hides the checkout type setting to prevent confusion.  
- Fixed a **missing notice for Stripe connection status**—users are now properly informed when disconnected from Stripe, both immediately after disconnection and on the **Settings > Stripe** page.  
- Fixed a **critical error when editing forms after disconnecting from Stripe**. Now, instead of a fatal error, users see a clear message instructing them to reconnect their Stripe account. Admins also receive guidance when previewing or displaying forms on the frontend.  
- Fixed an issue where **custom amount fields caused an error for /bin/sh products**, ensuring proper validation when allowing users to enter a custom amount.  
- Fixed an issue where **adding custom fields to save card forms did not work**, ensuring proper functionality for collecting additional user information.  
- Fixed an issue where **decimal values were ignored in the Custom Amount option**, preventing unintended overcharges and ensuring correct payment amounts.  
- Fixed an issue where **donation forms using inline checkout did not have a default product name**, preventing the form from being saved. Now, it uses the same default name as checkout mode.

Webhooks trigger on successful transactions, and a test button is included for easy setup.  
- Added a form preview feature, allowing users to quickly view their forms in a modal without manually inserting shortcodes on a page.  
- Introduced a basic block for selecting and inserting available forms, eliminating the need to copy and paste shortcodes manually.  
- Added compatibility with Stripe’s Customer Portal, allowing users to enable a setting that redirects customers to Stripe for subscription management, including upgrades, downgrades, and pauses.  

##### Enhancements  
- The setup notice can now be dismissed and includes a direct connection option for easier onboarding.  
- The connection page has been simplified with a cleaner design, correct fee display based on user status, and button styling matching Stripe branding.  
- The license key field has been moved to the plugin’s settings page for a more intuitive setup experience.

- Added a simple onboarding flow to streamline Stripe connection and form creation.  
- Added a test mode alert on forms and payment buttons, ensuring users know when transactions are in test mode, with a direct link to disable it.
